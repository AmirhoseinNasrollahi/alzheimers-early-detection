# Data Source and Privacy Policy

## Data Origin
The MRI data used in this project were obtained from the **Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)** database.  
All data were accessed and processed in compliance with the ADNI Data Use Agreement and ethical research standards.

| Modality | Number of slices (Z-matrix) | Field strength | Image type | Slice thickness | Sequence | Number of images | Age range |
|-----------|-----------------------------|----------------|-------------|------------------|-----------|------------------|------------|
| MRI | 176 | 3 T | T1-weighted | 1.2 mm | MP-RAGE | 50 per group | 50–70 years |

These specifications describe the subset of ADNI data used for the **hippocampal ROI extraction and frequency-domain analysis** phases in this repository.

## Data Availability
Due to **ethical and privacy considerations**, no raw MRI images or segmentation files are uploaded to this repository.  
Researchers who wish to reproduce the results can obtain the corresponding datasets directly from [ADNI](https://adni.loni.usc.edu) after completing the required data-use registration.

All code, configuration files, and documentation provided here are sufficient for full technical reproducibility without distributing any identifiable patient data.

## Ethical Commitment
This project strictly follows the principles of responsible data handling and respects participant confidentiality.  
The author values and upholds the privacy of every individual whose data contributed to the ADNI repository, and therefore avoids hosting or redistributing any identifiable medical imagery within this public repository.
